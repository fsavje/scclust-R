\description{
\code{sc_clustering} constructs near-optimal size-constrained clusterings.
Subject to user-specified constraints on the size and composition of the
clusters, a clustering is constructed so that within-cluster pair-wise
distances are minimized. The function does not restrict the number of
clusters.
}
\details{
\code{sc_clustering} constructs a clustering so to minimize within-cluster
dissimilarities while ensuring that constraints on the size and composition
of the clusters are satisfied. It is possible to impose an overall size
constraint so that each cluster must contain at least a certain number of
points in total. It is also possible to impose constraints on the composition
of the clusters so that each cluster must contain a certain number of points
of different types. For example, in a sample with "red" and "blue" data
points, one can constrain the clustering so that each cluster must contain
at least 10 points in total of which at least 3 must be "red" and at least
2 must be "blue".

The function implements an algorithm that first summaries the distances
between data points in a sparse graph and then constructs the clustering
based on the graph. This admits fast execution while ensuring near-optimal
performance. In particular, the maximum within-cluster distance is garantueed
to be at most four times the maximum distance in the optimal clustering.
The average performance is much closer to optimal than the worst case bound.

In more detail, the clustering algorithm has four steps:

\enumerate{
  \item Construct sparse graph encoding clustering constraints.
  \item Select a set of vertices in the graph to act as "seeds".
  \item Construct initial clusters from the seeds' neighborhoods in the graph.
  \item Assign remaining data points to clusters.
}

Each data point is represented by a vertex in the sparse graph, and arcs are
weighted by the distance between the data points they connect. The graph is
constructed so that each vertex's neighborhood satisfies the clustering
constraints supplied by the user. For example, if the clusters must contain
at least five points, each closed neighborhood in the graph will contain five
vertices. \code{sc_clustering} constructs the graph that minimize the arc
weights subject to the neighborhood constraints; this ensures near-optimal
performance. The function selects "seeds" that have non-overlapping
neighborhood in the graph. By constructing clusters as supersets of the
neighborhoods, it ensures that the clustering will satisfy the constraints
imposed by the user.

The \code{seed_method} option governs how the seeds are chosen. Any set of
seeds yields a near-optimal clustering, but, heuristically, performance can
be improved by picking the seeds more carefully. In most cases, smaller
clusters are desirable since they tend to minimize within-cluster distances.
As the number of data points is fixed, we minimize the cluster size by
maximizing the number of clusters (and, thus, the number of seeds). When
\code{seed_method} is set to "lexical", seeds are chosen in lexical order.
This admits a fast solution, but the function might pick points that are
central in the graph. Central points tend to exclude many other points from
being seeds and, thus, lead to larger clusters.

The "exclusion_order" and "exclusion_updating" options calculate for each
vertex how many other vertices are excluded if the vertex is picked as a seed.
By picking seeds that exclude few other vertices, the function avoids
central points and increases the number of seeds. "exclusion_updating"
updates the count after each picked seed so that already excluded vertices
are not counted twice; "exclusion_order" derives the count once. The former
option is, thus, better-performing but slower.

Deriving the exclusion count when using the "exclusion_order" and "exclusion_updating"
options is an expensive operation, and it might not be feasible to do so in
large samples. This is particularly problematic when the data points have
equidistant nearest neighbors, which tends to happen when the dataset contains
only discrete variables. It also happens when the dataset contains many
identical data points. The exclusion count operation may in these cases take
several orders of magnitude longer to run than the rest of the operations
combined. To ensure sane behavior for the default options, the exclusion
count is not used by default. If the dataset contains at least one continuous
variable, it is generally safe to call \code{sc_clustering} with either
"exclusion_order" or "exclusion_updating", and this will often improve performance
over the default.

The "inwards_order" and "inwards_updating" options count the number of
inwards-pointing arcs in the graph, which approximates the exclusion count.
"inwards_updating" updates the count after each picked seed, while
"inwards_order" derives the count once. The inwards counting options work
well with nearly all types of data, and "inwards_updating" is the default.

The "batches" option is identical to "lexical" but it derives the graph in
batches. This limits the use of memory to a value proportional to
\code{batch_size} irrespectively of the size of the dataset. This can be
useful when imposing large size constraints, which consume a lot of memory
in large datasets. The "batches" option is still experimental and can currently
only be used when one does not impose type constraints.

Once the function has selected seeds so that no additional points can be
selected without creating overlap in the graph, it constructs the initial
clusters. A unique cluster label is assigned to each seed, and all points
in the seed's neighborhood is assigned the same label. Some
data points might not be in a neighborhood of a seed and will, therefore,
not be assigned to a cluster after the initial clusters have been formed.
\code{primary_unassigned_method} specifies how the unassigned points are
assigned. With the "ignore" option, the points are left unassigned. With the
"any_neighbor", the function re-uses the sparse graph and assigns the
unassigned points to any adjacent cluster in the graph. The "closest_assigned"
option assigns the points to the clusters that contain their closest assigned
vertex, and the "closest_seed" option assigns to the cluster that contain
the closest seed. All these options ensure that the clustering is near-optimal.

Occasionally, some data points are allowed to be
left unassigned.  Consider the following prediction problem as an example. We
have a set of data points with a known outcome value ("training points") and
another set of points for which the outcome is unknown ("prediction points").
We want to use the training points to predict the outcome for the prediction
points. By clustering the data, we can use the cluster mean of the training
points to predict the values of the prediction points in the same cluster. To
make this viable, we need to ensure that each cluster contains at least one
training point (the cluster mean would otherwise be undefined). We can impose
this constraint using the \code{type_labels} and \code{type_constraints}
options. We also need to make sure that each prediction point is assigned to
a cluster. We do, however, not need that all training points are assigned a
cluster; some training points might not provide useful information (e.g.,
if they are very dissimilar to all prediction points). In this case, by
specifying only the prediction points in \code{primary_data_points}, we
ensure that all those points are assigned to clusters. The points not
specified in \code{primary_data_points} (i.e., the training points) will
be assigned to clustering only insofar that it is needed to satisfy the
clustering constraints. This can lead to large improvements in the clustering
if the types of points are unevenly distributed in the metric space. Points
not specified in \code{primary_data_points} are called "secondary".

Generally, one does not want to discard all unassigned secondary points --
some of them will, occasionally, be close to a cluster and contain useful
information. Similar to \code{primary_unassigned_method}, we can use the
\code{secondary_unassigned_method} to specify how the leftover secondary
points should be assigned. The three possible options are "ignore",
"closest_assigned" and "closest_seed". In nearly all cases, it is beneficial
to impose a radius constraint when assigning secondary points (see below for
details).

\code{sc_clustering} tries to minimize within-cluster distances subject to
that all (primary) data points are assigned to clusters. In some cases, it
might be beneficial to leave some points unassigned to avoid clusters with
very dissimilar points. The function has options that can be used to
indirectly constrain the maximum within-cluster distance. Specifically, by
restricting the maximum distance in the four steps of the function, we can
bound the maximum within-cluster distance. The bound is, however, a blunt
tool. A too small bound might lead to that only a few data points are
assigned to clusters. If a bound is needed, it is recommended to use a very
liberal bound. This will avoid the very dissimilar clusters, but let the
function optimize the remaining cluster assignments.

The \code{seed_radius} option limits the maximum distance between adjacent
vertices in the sparse graph. If the distance to a neighbor in a point's
neighborhood is greater than \code{seed_radius}, the neighborhood will be
deleted and the point is not allowed be a seed (it can, however, still be
in other points' neighborhoods). The \code{primary_radius} option limits
the maximum distance when a primary point is assigned to in the fourth step.
When \code{primary_radius} is set to a positive numeric value, this will be
used to as the radius restriction. "no_radius" and \code{NULL} indicate no
restriction. "seed_radius" indicates that the same restriction as
\code{seed_radius} should be used, and "estimated_radius" sets the
restriction to the estimated average distance between the seeds and their
neighbors. When \code{primary_unassigned_method} is set to "any_neighbor",
\code{primary_radius} must be set to "seed_radius".

The way the radius constraints restrict the maximum within-cluster distance
depends on the \code{primary_unassigned_method} option. When
\code{primary_unassigned_method} is "ignore", the maximum distance is bounded
by 2 * \code{seed_radius}. When \code{primary_unassigned_method} is
"any_neighbor", it is bounded by 4 * \code{seed_radius}. When
\code{primary_unassigned_method} is "closest_assigned", it is bounded by
2 * \code{seed_radius} + 2 * \code{primary_radius}. When
\code{primary_unassigned_method} is "closest_seed", it is bounded by the
maximum of 2 * \code{seed_radius} and 2 * \code{primary_radius}.

The \code{secondary_radius} option restricts how secondary points are
assigned, but is otherwise identical to the \code{primary_radius} option.
