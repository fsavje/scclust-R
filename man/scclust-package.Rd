\title{scclust: Size-Constrained Clustering}
\description{
The \code{scclust} package is an R wrapper for the \code{scclust} library.
The package provides functions to construct near-optimal size-constrained
clusterings. Subject to user-specified constraints on the size and composition
of the clusters, \code{scclust} constructs a clustering so that within-cluster
pair-wise distances are minimized.
}
\details{
The main clustering function is \code{\link{sc_clustering}}. Statistics about
clusters can be derived with the \code{\link{get_clustering_stats}}
function. To check if a clustering satisfies some set of
constraints, use \code{\link{check_clustering}}. Use \code{\link{scclust}} to
construct a \code{scclust} object from an existing clustering.

Clusters can also be constructed with \code{\link{hierarchical_clustering}}.
However, this function does not support type constraints and does not provide
optimality guarantees. Its main use is to refine clusterings constructed with
the \code{\link{sc_clustering}} function.

\code{scclust} was made with large data sets in mind, and it can cluster tens
of millions of data points within minutes on an ordinary desktop computer.
